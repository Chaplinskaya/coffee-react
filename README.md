Coffee React Project 
A React-based web application for a coffee shop, built to master the fundamental concepts of the library.

Key Features
Class-Based Architecture: Developed using Class Components to deeply understand React's core logic and lifecycle.

Dynamic Routing: Implemented multi-page navigation using react-router-dom.

Reusable Components: Created a modular system where components (like CardsSection) adapt their styles and content via props.

Data Management: Centralized data handling using a mock database (coffeeData.js) and JavaScript array methods like .map() and .slice().

Tech Stack
React.js (Class Components)

React Router

CSS3 (Custom styling & Flexbox)

JavaScript (ES6+)

Learning Goals
The main purpose of this project was to solidify the understanding of Props, State, and Conditional Rendering through a real-world architectural approach.
